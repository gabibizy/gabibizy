## 👋 Hey there, I'm Gabriela!
🐍 Python Backend Developer | 🎓 Information Systems graduate (2020) | 💼 2+ years of development experience.

🚀 I've always been passionate about technology and with the knowledge acquired during and beyond my college years, I found my path leaning towards Python. It's a powerful language with endless possibilities and currently, my focus at work lies in the development and maintenance of a Python-based chatbot, whether it's introducing new functionalities, building API connections, or refining our codebase.

🌟 I'm on a continuous learning journey to be my best version every day.
